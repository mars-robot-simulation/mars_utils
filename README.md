# mars_utils

MARS (Machina Arte Robotum Simulans) is a cross-platform simulation and visualisation tool created for robotics research developed at the [Robotics Innovation Center of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI-RIC)](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html) and the [University of Bremen](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/robotik/index_en.php).
MARS is designed in a modular manner and can be used very flexibly, e.g. by running the physics simulation without visualization and GUI.
It is possible to extend MARS writing your own plugins and many plugins introducing various functionality such as HUDs or custom ground reaction forces already exist - and it's easy to write your own.

This package provides general interfaces including type definitions and abstract classes.
